Introduction to Web Workers:
Web Workers allow you to run JavaScript code in the background without blocking the main thread, enabling concurrent processing.
Workers are separate execution contexts that can perform computationally intensive tasks, such as complex calculations or data processing.
Creating a Worker:
To create a web worker, create a new Worker object and provide the worker script file as an argument.
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

3. Worker Script:
The worker script is a separate JavaScript file that defines the code to be executed by the worker.
Inside the worker script, you can listen for messages from the main thread using the onmessage event handler.

// worker.js
self.onmessage = function(event) {
  // Handle message from main thread
  const data = event.data;
  // Perform some computations
  const result = doComputations(data);
  // Send result back to the main thread
  self.postMessage(result);
};

4.Communicating with the Worker:
You can send messages from the main thread to the worker using the postMessage() method and listen for responses using the onmessage event handler.
// Sending message from the main thread
worker.postMessage(data);

// Listening for response in the main thread
worker.onmessage = function(event) {
  const result = event.data;
  // Handle the result from the worker
};

5.Terminating a Worker:
You can terminate a worker using the terminate() method. Terminated workers can't be restarted.
worker.terminate();

6. Error Handling:
It's important to handle errors in web workers to prevent them from silently failing.
Listen for the onerror event to handle errors that occur within the worker.
worker.onerror = function(event) {
  console.error('Error in worker:', event);
};

7. Limitations and Considerations:
Web workers have some limitations, such as restricted access to the DOM and certain APIs.
Communication with workers involves message passing and serialization of data.
Worker scripts must be hosted on the same domain due to the same-origin policy.
