Introduction to Sequencing Animations:
Sequencing animations involves executing animations in a specific order, one after another.
Asynchronous JavaScript techniques, such as promises and async/await, can be used to create smooth and coordinated animations.
setTimeout():
The setTimeout() function can be used to introduce delays between animations.
It takes a callback function and a time duration in milliseconds as arguments.
By chaining multiple setTimeout() calls, you can sequence animations with delays.
setTimeout(function() {
  // Animation 1
}, 1000);

setTimeout(function() {
  // Animation 2
}, 2000);

3.Promises and Chaining:
Promises provide a more structured and readable way to sequence animations.
By returning promises from animation functions and chaining them using .then(), animations can be executed one after another.

function animateElement(element, animation) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve) {
    // Perform animation on the element
    // Call resolve() when animation is complete
  });
}

animateElement(element1, animation1)
  .then(function() {
    return animateElement(element2, animation2);
  })
  .then(function() {
    return animateElement(element3, animation3);
  })
  .then(function() {
    // All animations completed
  });

4. async/await:
The async and await keywords provide a more concise and synchronous-like way to sequence animations.
By marking the function as async and using await before each animation function, animations can be executed sequentially.
async function sequenceAnimations() {
  await animateElement(element1, animation1);
  await animateElement(element2, animation2);
  await animateElement(element3, animation3);
  // All animations completed
}

sequenceAnimations();

5. Error Handling:
When using promises or async/await for sequencing animations, ensure proper error handling.
Use .catch() or try-catch blocks to catch and handle any errors that occur during animations.
animateElement(element1, animation1)
  .then(function() {
    return animateElement(element2, animation2);
  })
  .then(function() {
    return animateElement(element3, animation3);
  })
  .catch(function(error) {
    // Handle error
  });
